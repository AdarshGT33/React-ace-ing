# React-ace-ing

This is an ONLY UI made by using REACT and React-Router-DOM

It does not support any backend services as you prohibited the use of Node and Express and I do not know Django Rest framework and MySQL.

I tried my best to fulfill whatever was asked in the assessment to the best of my ability.

Following are the screenshots of the assessment:
