# React-ace-ing
#This is an ONLY UI made by using REACT.
#It does not support any backend services as you prohibited the use of Node and Express and I do not know Django Rest framework and MySQL.
#I tried my best to fulfill whatever was asked in the assessment to the best of my ability.
#I felt very restricted in only React.
Following are the screenshots of the assessment:
